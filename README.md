# EAP
EAP is an opensource project which aims at optimizing the software made by the openAPS (https://openaps.org/) project. The idea behind is that we'd like to shrink the hardware which is currently supported by the openAPS. The code of the device is being redesigned into C++, so it can run on a microcontroller(ESP32). We have decided to use a microcontroller since its compact size will make the device very portable.
